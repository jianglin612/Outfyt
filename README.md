# Outfyt

## Installation

1. Download the project and install dependencies with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) with `pod install`.
2. Wait for dependencies from `PodFile` to be installed, should create a `Pods/` directory locally.
3. Open `Outfyt.xcworkspace`, not the project file. This will include statically linked Pods (Facebook SDK and Parse).
